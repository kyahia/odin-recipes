    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Mashed potato, mashed potatoes or mashed taters, colloquially known as mash, is a dish made by 
        mashing boiled potatoes, usually with added milk, butter, salt and pepper. It is generally served 
        as a side dish to meat or vegetables. When the potatoes are only roughly mashed, they are sometimes 
        called smashed potatoes.
